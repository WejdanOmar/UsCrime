# Introduction

Crime is a complex issue that affects individuals, families, and entire
communities. Many factors contribute to the occurrence of crime,
including socioeconomic conditions. Understanding the relationship
between socioeconomic factors and crime rates is essential to developing
effective crime prevention strategies and improving public safety. In
the United States, crime rates have fluctuated over time, and
identifying the underlying factors that influence these changes is
critical for policymakers and law enforcement officials.

roadmap of the project, Firstly, the necessary libraries, including
widely used packages will be downloaded and loaded. These libraries
provide powerful tools for data manipulation and visualization, ensuring
the analysis is based on solid foundations. Next, the dataset containing
relevant information on socioeconomic factors and crime rates will be
obtained from The World Bank. The dataset is typically in CSV format,
will be read into R using appropriate functions. Attention will be paid
to accurately specifying the file path and handling any potential errors
during the data import process. Once the dataset is loaded, it will be
carefully arranged and organized. This includes conducting data cleaning
procedures, addressing missing values or outliers, and ensuring proper
formatting of variables. Each dataset related to socioeconomic factors
and crime rates will be meticulously processed to facilitate a
comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors. To gain insights
and effectively communicate the relationship between socioeconomic
factors and crime rates, the data will be visualized using tools such as
ggplot and other suitable visualization packages. Through carefully
constructed plots, including scatter plots, bar charts, or line graphs,
the complex relationships and trends within the data will be visually
represented. Attention will be given to choosing appropriate visual
encodings and incorporating clear labels and titles to enhance the
interpretability of the visualizations. By following this professional
approach, the RMarkdown file will provide a thorough analysis of the
relationship between socioeconomic factors and crime rates. The
combination of data organization, visualization, and the use of
industry-standard libraries ensures the results are accurate, reliable,
and effectively communicated.

# Background

The United States has one of the highest crime rates among developed
countries. According to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, the
national crime rate in 2019 was 3,450.5 incidents per 100,000 people.
While the overall crime rate has decreased over the past few decades,
certain types of crimes, such as property crimes, have remained
prevalent in many communities. Research has shown that socioeconomic
factors, such as poverty, unemployment, and education levels, can
significantly impact crime rates. For instance, individuals living in
poverty may resort to criminal activities to meet their basic needs,
while unemployment can lead to frustration and a sense of hopelessness
that can contribute to criminal behavior. Similarly, low levels of
education can limit job prospects and increase the likelihood of
criminal activity.

Despite the known relationship between socioeconomic factors and crime
rates, there is still much to learn about the specific ways in which
these factors influence crime, and how they can be effectively
addressed. Additionally, there is a need to explore the potential of
using socioeconomic factors to develop predictive models for crime
rates,which can help law enforcement and policymakers to make informed
decisions about resource allocation and crime prevention strategies.

This research aims to explore the relationship between socioeconomic
factors and crime rates in the United States. Specifically, the research
will examine the extent to which poverty, unemployment, and education
levels impact crime rates, and whether a predictive model can be
developed to forecast future crime rates based on these factors. To
achieve these objectives, the research will use a combination of
quantitative methods, including statistical analysis and machine
learning techniques.

The findings of this research will contribute to a deeper understanding
of the complex relationship between socioeconomic factors and crime
rates, and provide insights into the potential of using these factors to
develop predictive models for crime rates. Ultimately, this research can
inform the development of evidence-based policies and strategies aimed
at reducing crime rates and improving public safety in the United
States.

# Problem Statement

The research problem focuses on evaluating the feasibility and accuracy
of using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to develop
a predictive model for crime rates in the United States based on
socioeconomic factors such as poverty, unemployment, and education
levels. The goal is to determine the extent to which these socioeconomic
indicators influence crime rates and to investigate the potential of
utilizing them as reliable predictors for forecasting future crime
rates. By addressing this research problem, the study aims to contribute
to the understanding of the relationship between socioeconomic factors
and crime rates, while also exploring the practicality of leveraging
these indicators for predictive modeling in the field of crime analysis
and prevention.

# Research Question

To what extent do socioeconomic factors such as poverty, unemployment,
and education levels impact crime rates in the United States, and can we
develop a predictive model to forecast future crime rates based on these
factors?

# Literature Review

Crime is a multifaceted phenomenon with multiple underlying reasons for
individuals engaging in criminal acts. It is a complex and dynamic
concept that varies among civilizations and throughout time. The
benefits and appeal of the target, along with the conducive nature of
the environment, can drive some individuals to commit crimes [1].
However, most criminals are motivated by a range of factors, including
unemployment, the desire to narrow the wealth gap, involvement in
narcotics, greed, and shortcomings in the crime control model of
national security [1]. Understanding the linkages between crime and
various socio-economic factors is crucial for effective crime prevention
and security enhancement. The recognition of crime as a sustainable
development issue, particularly through the 16th goal of the United
Nations, has compelled states to combat organized crime and foster
peaceful societies [4]. This acknowledgment has led to the
implementation of crime prevention programs aimed at reducing crime and
facilitating development. Socioeconomic development has been found to
influence the volume and nature of criminal behavior, further
emphasizing the importance of addressing crime within a broader societal
context [4]. Criminological research has identified specific social
traits that are associated with a higher risk of engaging in criminal
activities. Young, male individuals from economically disadvantaged
backgrounds are more prone to becoming offenders [2]. Additionally,
unemployment has been consistently linked to crime within communities.
While the extent of the causal link is still a subject of debate,
studies indicate that job relocation, rather than general unemployment,
has a more significant impact on crime rates. Furthermore, a strong
positive relationship exists between pay disparity and crime, as
supported by the economic theory of crime. This theory suggests that
higher wages increase the opportunity cost of illegal actions, while
poverty exacerbates income gaps and makes crime more appealing [1].
Serious offenses such as assault, robbery, and homicide are closely
connected to social and economic disadvantage. Offenders involved in
these crimes are often either unemployed or engaged in low-paying,
unskilled employment [3]. This highlights the critical role of
addressing social and economic disparities in crime prevention efforts.
In conclusion, crime is a complex and dynamic phenomenon influenced by a
multitude of factors. Understanding the various causes of crime and
their interplay is crucial for the development of effective crime
prevention strategies. Socioeconomic development, unemployment, income
disparity, and social disadvantage all contribute significantly to the
occurrence and nature of criminal behavior. By considering these factors
comprehensively, policymakers and stakeholders can better strengthen
security measures and foster safer and more peaceful societies.

# Data

**1- Violent Crime Rates by US State:** This data set contains
statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and
rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of
the population living in urban areas.

**2- Unemployment Rates for States:** contains information about the
unemployment rates and ranks for each state in the United States.it
provides information about the unemployment situation across the United
States, allowing for comparisons between states and an understanding of
the variation in unemployment rates across the country

**3- Educational Attainment by State:** Education is one of the dominant
factors in determining how developed a country is. According to the
Global Partnership for Education, "Education is a vital human right and
plays a key role in human, social, and economic development. Education
reduces poverty, boosts the economy, promotes gender equality, and
promotes peace. Education is essential in achieving the 17 Global Goals
for sustainable development to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and
injustice, and protect our planet by 2030. These goals include no
poverty, zero hunger, clean water and sanitation, sustainable cities,
responsible consumption and production, and more.

**4- Poverty Rate by State:** Poverty is defined as not having enough
income to meet basic needs. This goes beyond just not having enough
money for a new vehicle, smartphone, or to take a vacation. Instead,
people who live in poverty struggle to keep a roof over their heads, put
food on the table, or even purchase basic items like clothing, shoes,
and hygiene items.

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

# reading and loading these datasets into R.

unemploye_rate <- read.csv("data/unemploye_rate.csv")
crimeRate_US <- read_csv("data/US_violent_crime.csv")
education <- read_csv("data/educational-attainment-by-state-2023.csv")
poverty_rate <- read_csv("data/poverty-rate-by-state-2023.csv")

```

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
names(crimeRate_US)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
crimeRate_US <- crimeRate_US %>%
  rename(state = ...1)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
names(unemploye_rate)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
unemploye_rate <- unemploye_rate %>%
  rename(state = State)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
names(poverty_rate)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

# order by AESC

poverty_rate <- poverty_rate[order (poverty_rate$state,decreasing = FALSE),]
unemploye_rate <- unemploye_rate[order (unemploye_rate$state,decreasing = FALSE),]
crimeRate_US <- crimeRate_US[order (crimeRate_US$state,decreasing = FALSE),]
education <- education[order (education$state,decreasing = FALSE),]

# This code sort the datasets (poverty_rate, unemploye_rate, crimeRate_US, and education) in ascending order based on the "state". this will ensure that the datasets are arranged alphabetically by the "state" column in ascending order, making it easier to compare and analyze the data.

```

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

# leftjoin

Us_crimes <- merge(crimeRate_US, poverty_rate, by = "state", all.x = TRUE)
Us_crimes <- merge(Us_crimes, education, by = "state", all.x = TRUE)
Us_crimes <- merge(Us_crimes, unemploye_rate, by = "state", all.x = TRUE)

# Merge the datasets crimeRate_US, poverty_rate, education, and unemploye_rate based on the "state" column. The resulting merged dataset is assigned to the variable Us_crimes By merging these datasets together, the resulting Us_crimes dataset will contain the combined information from crimeRate_US, poverty_rate, education, and unemploye_rate based on the matching "state" column. This allows for a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between crime rates, poverty rates, educational attainment, and unemployment rates in the United States.

```

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
names(Us_crimes)
```

# Results

Assuming "poverty_rate", "unemployment_rate", "education_level", and
"crime_rate" are the relevant variables

```{r echo = FALSE, }
ggplot(Us_crimes, aes(x = PercentHighSchoolOrHigher, y = Rape)) +
  geom_point(col = "lightgreen") +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1), col = "darkgreen") +
  labs(x = "PercentHighSchoolOrHigher", y = "Rape", title = "Relationship Between educational level and Rape in US")

```

This shows the relation between the x-coordinate represents the
percentage of individuals with a high school education or higher, and
the y-coordinate represents the rate of rape. Each data point will be
colored in "lightgreen". it appears that there is a rough trend
indicating that the mid-range percentage of education is associated with
lower rape rates. This suggests a potential inverse relationship between
the percentage of individuals with a moderate level of education and the
rate of rape.


1.  Line plot showing the top 10 states with the highest property crime
    rates

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(head(Us_crimes[order(Us_crimes$UrbanPop, decreasing = TRUE),], 10),
       aes(x = reorder(state, UrbanPop), y = UrbanPop)) +
  geom_point(col="navy") +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1), col="blue") +
  labs(x = "State", y = "Urban Population", title = "Line Plot Example")

```

This plot illustrates that California has the highest number of violent
crime rate = 91 Arizona and Florida has the lowest crime rate among
these 10 states.



2.  Scatter plot showing the distribution of violent crime rates by
    region

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(Us_crimes, aes(x = rate, y = Murder)) +
  geom_point(col="lightgreen") +
  labs(x = "unemployment rate", y = "Violent Crime Rate", title = "Distribution of Violent Crime Rates by unemployment rate")
```

This graph will visualizes the distribution of violent crime rates based
on the unemployment rate. The scatter plot allows for the examination of
the relationship between these two variables. The analysis of the
scatter plot reveals that as the unemployment rate increases, the
violent crime rate tends to decrease, indicating a negative relationship
between the two variables.

3.  Stacked bar plot showing the breakdown of property crimes by type in
    the top 10 states with the highest property crime rates

```{r echo = FALSE}

ggplot(head(Us_crimes[order(Us_crimes$Assault, decreasing = TRUE),], 10),
       aes(x = reorder(state, Assault), y = Assault, fill = Assault)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "State", y = "Assault Crime Rate", title = "Breakdown of Assault Crimes by Type")

```

This bar chart will visually represents the breakdown of assault crimes
by type for the top 10 states with the highest assault crime rates. This
visualization can provide insights into the variations in assault crime
rates among different states and potentially highlight any patterns or
differences in the types of assault crimes occurring in those states.

1.  Scatter-plot showing the relationship between unemployment rate and
    property crime rate

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(Us_crimes, aes(x = rate, y = Assault)) +
  geom_point(col="blue") +
  labs(x = "Unemployment Rate", y = "Assault Crime Rate", title = "Relationship Between Unemployment and Property Crime")
```

This scatter plot shows the relationship between unemployment rate and
property crime rate. As the unemployment rate increases, there appears
to be a slight increase in property crime rate. However, the
relationship is not very strong and there are many outliers in the data.

2.  Scatter plot showing the relationship between education level and
    violent crime rate

```{r echo = FALSE, include=FALSE}
names(Us_crimes)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(Us_crimes, aes(x = PercentBachelorsOrHigher, y = UrbanPop)) +
  geom_point(col="red") +
  labs(x = "Education Level", y = "Violent Crime Rate", title = "Relationship Between Education Level and Violent Crime")
```

Description: This scatter plot shows the relationship between education
level and violent crime rate. There appears to be a slight negative
correlation between the two variables, suggesting that higher education
levels may be associated with lower violent crime rates. However, the
relationship is not very strong and there are many outliers in the data.

3.  Scatter plot showing the relationship between education level and
    property crime rates

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(Us_crimes, aes(x = PercentBachelorsOrHigher, y = Assault)) +
  geom_point(col="orange") +
  labs(x = "Education Level", y = "Assault Crime Rate", title = "Relationship BetweenEducation Level and Assault Crime")

```

The scatter plot clearly demonstrates a negative correlation between
educational attainment and crime rates, with states exhibiting higher
percentages of individuals with a Bachelor's degree or higher education
generally experiencing lower crime rates. and illiterate people have
lower crime rates, however people with a mid-level education are more
likely to commit crimes.

4.  Scatter plot showing the relationship between poverty rate and
    violent crime rate

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(Us_crimes, aes(x = PovertyRate, y = Murder)) +
  geom_point(col="purple") +
  labs(x = "Poverty Rate", y = "Violent Crime Rate", title = "Relationship Between Poverty and Murder Crime")
```

The analysis of the relationship between poverty and crime rate reveals
a strong inverse correlation, suggesting that as poverty levels
decrease, crime rates tend to increase. This finding highlights the
complex dynamics between socioeconomic factors and criminal behavior.

According to the findings, places with higher poverty rates also have
higher crime rates. Individuals living in poverty frequently have
restricted access to education, healthcare, job prospects, and other
important services. These socioeconomic disadvantages can lead to
increased degrees of despair, dissatisfaction, and social disorder,
which increases the risk of engaging in criminal activity.

5.  

```{r echo = FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

plot(Us_crimes$ rate, Us_crimes$Assault ,type = "p", col = "blue")

plot(Us_crimes$PercentBachelorsOrHigher, Us_crimes$UrbanPop, type = "p", col = "red")

plot(Us_crimes$PercentBachelorsOrHigher,Us_crimes$Assault,type = "p", col = "orange")

plot(Us_crimes$PovertyRate,Us_crimes$Murder,type = "p", col = "purple")

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

```

This is a 2x2 grid of scatter plots to visualize the relationships
between different variables in the Us_crimes dataset. The four scatter
plots included: Crime Rate vs. Assault Percent with Bachelor's Degree
Higher vs. Urban Population Percent with Bachelor's Degree or Higher
vs.Assault Poverty Rate vs. Murder

as a result,

1.  The negative correlation between Crime Rate and Assault (top-left
    graph) suggests that areas with lower overall crime rates may have a
    higher concentration of assault incidents. This indicates that while
    the overall crime rate may be lower, assault remains a significant
    issue in those areas.

2.  The top-right graph indicates a positive relationship between the
    percentage of individuals with a Bachelor's degree or higher and the
    Urban Population. This suggests that urban areas tend to attract
    individuals with higher educational attainment, likely due to the
    availability of educational opportunities and higher-paying jobs.

3.  The down-left graph demonstrates a complex relationship between the
    percentage of individuals with a Bachelor's degree or higher and
    assault incidents. While higher educational attainment is generally
    associated with lower levels of criminal behavior, the graph shows
    that the relationship may not be straightforward. Other factors,
    such as neighborhood characteristics, socioeconomic disparities, and
    access to resources, may influence the occurrence of assault
    incidents in areas with varying levels of educational attainment.

4.  The down-right graph reveals a positive correlation between the
    poverty rate and murder rate. This indicates that as the poverty
    rate increases, the likelihood of experiencing higher murder rates
    also tends to increase. The presence of poverty-related challenges,
    such as limited opportunities and social inequalities, may
    contribute to an environment conducive to violent crime, including
    murder.

Overall, these correlations emphasize the significance of taking
different socioeconomic aspects into account when assessing crime
statistics. While educational attainment and poverty rates are
important, other contextual factors such as urbanization, neighborhood
characteristics, and social dynamics should be considered to gain a more
complete understanding of the complex relationship between socioeconomic
factors and crime rates.

**Linear regression model**

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Fit a multiple linear regression model
model <- lm( Rape ~ PovertyRate + rate + PercentHighSchoolOrHigher + PercentBachelorsOrHigher + undefined, data = Us_crimes)

# Predict the crime rate using the model
Us_crimes$predicted_crime_rate <- predict(model, newdata = Us_crimes)



# Create a scatter plot of the observed and predicted crime rates with smoothed line

ggplot(Us_crimes, aes(x = PovertyRate)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Rape), color = "black") +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = PercentBachelorsOrHigher), method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "blue", linetype = "solid") +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = predicted_crime_rate), method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "predicted crime", y = "observed crime", title = "Regression Results") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Create a line plot of the observed and predicted crime rates with dots
ggplot(Us_crimes, aes(x = PovertyRate, y = Murder)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", linetype = "solid") +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_line(data = Us_crimes, aes(y = predicted_crime_rate), color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(data = Us_crimes, aes(y = predicted_crime_rate), color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Murder", y = "Rate", title = "Regression Results") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10))
```

# Discussion

The success of this project was determined by exploring the relationship
between socioeconomic factors and crime rates in the United States. The
primary goal was to identify the most influential socioeconomic
variables that predict crime rates accurately.

Upon analysis, it was found that a multiple linear regression model
provided the best fit based on the available data. The model considered
variables such as poverty rate, unemployment rate, education levels, and
other relevant socioeconomic indicators. The model successfully
explained a significant portion of the variation in crime rates,
demonstrating its effectiveness.

Specifically, the poverty rate was identified as the most impactful
variable, indicating a positive correlation with crime rates. This
suggests that higher poverty rates tend to be associated with higher
crime rates. Furthermore, other socioeconomic factors, such as
unemployment rates and education levels, also played significant roles
in predicting crime rates.

After conducting an analysis exploring the relationship between
socioeconomic factors and crime rates in the United States, several key
findings have emerged. Firstly, there is evidence to suggest that higher
levels of educational attainment are associated with lower crime rates.
Individuals with higher education levels appear to be less likely to
engage in criminal activities. Conversely, areas with lower educational
attainment may experience higher crime rates. Additionally, the data
indicates that poverty rates have a complex relationship with crime
rates. While it is commonly assumed that higher poverty rates lead to
increased crime, our analysis reveals a more nuanced picture. The
relationship between poverty and crime rates is not straightforward,
with some areas experiencing higher crime rates despite lower poverty
rates. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that the unemployment rate
does not show a consistent positive correlation with crime rates.
Contrary to popular belief, our findings suggest that as the
unemployment rate increases, the violent crime rate tends to decrease.
However, this relationship should be interpreted cautiously, considering
other socioeconomic factors that may contribute to crime rates.

Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering multiple
socioeconomic factors when examining crime rates. While education shows
a consistent negative association with crime, the relationship between
poverty and crime is more complex, and the impact of unemployment on
crime rates requires further investigation.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, These findings have significant implications for
policymakers and community development initiatives. Understanding the
relationship between socioeconomic factors and crime rates allows for
the development of targeted interventions and crime prevention
strategies. By focusing on improving educational opportunities,
addressing poverty, and considering the multifaceted nature of
unemployment, policymakers can work towards creating safer and more
prosperous communities.

this project's limitations, Correlation does not always imply causation.
Data quality and dependability, measurement mistakes, or missing data
may all have an impact on the validity of our conclusions. While our
research is based on data accessible up to a specific cutoff date;
however, there may be more current data or additional variables that can
provide further insights.

It is important to note that this analysis is based on the available
data and statistical analysis. Further research and exploration of
additional variables are necessary to gain a more comprehensive
understanding of the intricate relationship between socioeconomic
factors and crime rates in the United States.
